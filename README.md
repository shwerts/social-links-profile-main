- Flexbox
- Microdata (Schema.org)

### What I learned

I implemented microdata for the profile card from schema.org

### Continued development

Go further in a11y, especially microdata

### Useful resources

- [Heydon's article about <address> element](https://heydonworks.com/article/the-address-element/) - This helped me to understand which address I should wrap with `<address>` element.
- [Using microdata for person](https://www.antoniogioia.com/how-to-use-microdata-person) - It gives an example for a web-dev's use of 'Person' microdata
